# Mog Assistant

Mog Assistant is a lightweight World of Warcraft add-on that allows the user to browse the collection of appearances with keyboard arrows and mouse clicks, just as he can in the transmog window, and get a quick preview of these items on his character.

The add-on displays a border around the previewed model for ease of navigation.

To help with the development of the add-on, please report any encountered issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meivyn/MogAssistant/issues).
