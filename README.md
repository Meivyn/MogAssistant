# Mog Assistant

Mog Assistant is an extremely lightweight World of Warcraft add-on that allows the user to browse the collection of appearances with the keyboard, as he can in the transmog window, to get a quick preview of these items on his character.

The add-on displays a border around the previewed model for ease of navigation.

Use arrows on the keyboard when the collection of appearances is opened to get started.

## Known issues

If you want to help about these issues or if you find new ones, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meivyn/MogAssistant/issues).

- Sometimes there's an error complaining about equipping item when you navigate. I don't have any clue about this.
- You can't change more than one page at a time to continue the navigation on the new page.
