# Mog Assistant

Mog Assistant is an extremely lightweight World of Warcraft add-on that allows the user to browse the collection of appearances with the keyboard, as he can in the transmog window, to get a quick preview of these items on his character.

The add-on displays a border around the previewed model for ease of navigation.

Use arrows on the keyboard when the collection of appearances is opened to get started.
