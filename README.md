# Mog Assistant

Mog Assistant is a lightweight World of Warcraft add-on that allows the user to browse the collection of appearances with keyboard arrows and mouse clicks, just as he can in the transmog window, and get a quick preview of these items on his character.

The add-on displays a border around the previewed model for ease of navigation.

## Known issues

If you want to help about these issues or if you find new ones, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meivyn/MogAssistant/issues).

- There's an error complaining about equipping an item when you navigate through uncollected or unusable appearances, due to how ``DressUpVisual`` works. But it's also happening randomly and I don't have any clue about this.
